## Hello, I'm Jerry Liu 👋
I'm currently a student studying 【MSc Statistics in Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/courses/postgraduate-taught/statistics/).
I graduated at Queen Mary with BSc Mathematics and Statistics in 2025. I did a third year project using Monte Carlo simulations about Self-Avoiding Walks(SAWs) supervised by Prof. Thomas. I independently learned and used Julia to do this project.


**Featured Projects**
- FlatPERM for SAWs: https://github.com/JerryLiu826/Cactus_SAW

**Skills**
- Programming: Python, C++, Julia, R
