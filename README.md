## Hello, I'm Jerry Liu ðŸ‘‹
I'm currently a student studying MSc Statistics in Imperial College London.
I graduated at Queen Mary with BSc Mathematics and Statistics in 2025. I did a third year project using Monte Carlo simulations about Self-Avoiding Walks(SAWs) supervised by Prof. Thomas. I independently learned and used Julia to do this project.
